# HDK: H.O.R.N.E.T.S Development Kit

## Empowering App Developers

This Go library allows desktop apps to connect and communicate with the Hornet Storage relay. We have made the functions as simple as possible while still exposing lower level functionality for more advanced use cases and customization.

The library includes a very basic connection manager to help users handle being connected and communicating with multiple Hornet Storage relays at once.

## Documentation

Documentation coming soon.

## Disclaimer
⚠️ **Warning**: This library is currently in its development phase. It is not yet stable and is not recommended for production use. Users are advised to exercise caution. This repository will progress more as we develop Hornet Storage. More comprehensive information will be provided soon.
