# Go Hornet Storage Lib

This Go library allows desktop apps to connect and communicate with the Hornet Storage relay. We have made the functions as simple as possible while still exposing lower level functionality for more advanced use cases and customization.

The library includes a very basic connection manager to help users handle being connected and communicating with multiple Hornet Storage relays at once.
